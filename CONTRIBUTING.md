# Contributing info

## Overview

Contributions of any form are welcome, issue reports, PRs, feedback, etc.

## Requirements

All PRs must be based on and targeting the `develop` branch in order to have
an always stable branch, following the commonly known git flow in the naming of
the branches.

It would also be helpful for `bugfix/*` branches to have a corresponding issue
open that provides information about the problem encountered.

## Attribution

All authors will be attributed either in the README file or in a separate
section that does not make the README too long and annoying to read. As for
`feature/*` branches, whenever bigger functionality is added a GIF that
demonstrates the changes in action would be greatly appreciated.
